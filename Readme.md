### 30 Days of Web3

In this 30 days, I'll build 30 DApps and share my learnings.

- My lnaguage of choice is Solidity

- Development environment will be foundry and Remix

### Here is a list of the tasks for each day.

- [x] [**Day 1: Hello Blockchain**](https://github.com/ezesundayeze/30days-of-web3/tree/main/hello-world)
      Write a simple smart contract that stores and retrieves a message from the blockchain.
- [x] [**Day 2: Simple Token (ERC-20)**](https://github.com/ezesundayeze/30days-of-web3/blob/main/erc-20-token/src/ERC20WithOZ.sol)  
       Create an ERC-20 token using the Ethereum standard. Implement basic functions like `mint`, `transfer`, and `balanceOf`.
- [x] [**Day 3: Voting System**](https://github.com/ezesundayeze/30days-of-web3/tree/main/voting)
      Build a decentralized voting system where users can cast votes on various options.
- [x] [**Day 4: Crowdfunding Contract**](https://github.com/ezesundayeze/30days-of-web3/tree/main/crowd-funding)  
       Develop a smart contract where people can contribute funds, and once a target is reached, the funds can be withdrawn by the campaign creator.
- [ ] [**Day 5: Decentralized Escrow**](https://github.com/ezesundayeze/30days-of-web3/tree/main/escrow)  
       Create an escrow contract where a buyer sends funds, and once the seller delivers a product, the buyer can release the funds to the seller.
- [ ] **Day 6: Auction System**  
       Build a basic decentralized auction. Users can place bids, and the highest bidder wins after a certain time.
- [ ] **Day 7: Simple NFT (ERC-721)**  
       Write a basic ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token smart contract. Implement the minting, transferring, and viewing of NFTs.
- [ ] **Day 8: Time-Locked Wallet**  
       Create a wallet contract where funds can only be withdrawn after a certain timestamp.
- [ ] **Day 9: Multi-Sig Wallet**  
       Build a multi-signature wallet where a group of participants must approve transactions before they can be executed.
- [ ] **Day 10: Decentralized Name Registry**  
       Implement a name registry similar to ENS (Ethereum Name Service) where users can register and map names to addresses.
- [ ] **Day 11: Subscription Payments**  
       Develop a smart contract where users can subscribe to a service, and recurring payments are handled automatically.
- [ ] **Day 12: Token Vesting**  
       Create a token vesting contract where tokens are released over time to a recipient after specific intervals.
- [ ] **Day 13: Lottery Contract**  
       Implement a simple lottery system where participants can buy tickets, and a winner is chosen randomly after a certain time period.
- [ ] **Day 14: Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**  
       Build a basic decentralized exchange where users can swap between different ERC-20 tokens.
- [ ] **Day 15: Staking Platform**  
       Create a staking contract where users can stake tokens and earn rewards over time based on the length of their staking.
- [ ] **Day 16: Identity Verification (KYC)**  
       Write a contract that tracks whether users have passed KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) verification using a simple flagging mechanism.
- [ ] **Day 17: DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**  
       Create a basic DAO structure where token holders can vote on proposals and decisions are executed automatically based on the outcome.
- [ ] **Day 18: Decentralized Raffle**  
       Build a raffle system where participants can enter by buying tickets, and the winner is selected using a pseudorandom function.
- [ ] **Day 19: Savings Pool**  
       Implement a savings pool where multiple users deposit funds, and the contract earns interest for a specific time before distributing it back proportionally.
- [ ] **Day 20: P2P Lending Contract**  
       Write a smart contract for peer-to-peer lending, where lenders can offer loans with interest rates, and borrowers can request funds.
- [ ] **Day 21: Decentralized Marketplace**  
       Create a simple marketplace where users can list items for sale and others can purchase them using tokens.
- [ ] **Day 22: Prediction Market**  
       Build a prediction market where users can bet on future events, and winners get rewarded based on the outcomes.
- [ ] **Day 23: NFT Marketplace**  
       Develop an NFT marketplace where users can list, buy, and sell NFTs with simple bidding or direct purchase options.
- [ ] **Day 24: Decentralized Insurance**  
       Create an insurance contract where users can pool funds, and payouts are automatically triggered by specific conditions (e.g., an oracle providing weather data).
- [ ] **Day 25: Streaming Payments (Sablier)**  
       Build a payment streaming contract where funds are transferred over time (e.g., paying employees by the second instead of in bulk).
- [ ] **Day 26: Social Token**  
       Create a social token contract where creators or influencers can mint their own token for their communities.
- [ ] **Day 27: Token-Based Access Control**  
       Implement a smart contract where ownership of specific tokens (e.g., NFTs) grants access to a certain service or resource.
- [ ] **Day 28: Yield Farming Contract**  
       Develop a yield farming smart contract where users can provide liquidity to earn rewards, mimicking DeFi platforms like Uniswap or SushiSwap.
- [ ] **Day 29: Cross-Chain Bridge (Simplified)**  
       Create a simplified cross-chain bridge contract where tokens can be locked on one blockchain and minted or unlocked on another.
- [ ] **Day 30: Layer 2 Payment Channel**  
       Implement a basic payment channel where two parties can exchange tokens off-chain and only settle on-chain when the channel is closed.
